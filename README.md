# Roll A Ball

Roll A Ball is a **single-player desktop game demo** developed in **Unity** as a **solo personal project**.  
The game is inspired by classic **arcade-style physics games**, where the player controls a rolling ball to collect items while avoiding obstacles and enemies.

The focus of this project was on **player movement, physics-based controls, simple AI behavior, and core gameplay systems**.

The project consists of **one playable level**, designed as a focused demo rather than a full-length game.
